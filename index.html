							<h2>INTERNET OF THINGS</h2>

									<h3>LoRaWAN and The Things Network</h3>
									<p>IoT devices often require interconnections in a network such as Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN). One
										way of creating such connection is by using LoraWAN - LoraWAN is a low power wide area networking
										protocol. Acceeration, relative humidity and temperature measurements taken by a PySense device were collected, processed and transmitted using LoRa to The
										Things Network(TTN). The LoPy board is connected to a LoRaWAN gaateway.  Integration to some third party
										system for data visualization and possible analysis. In this case, Cayenne (myDevices) was used</p>

									<h3>The Remote Butler</h3>
									<p>
										The remote Butler device is an IoT device that enables wireless communication between the sender (presumed to be the house owner) 
										and a Receiver (presumed to be the Butler). The Sender device contains 3 buttons which signifies 3 different commands.
										On the Receiver device, there are 3 LEDs each corresponding to the 3 different Sender buttons commands. Also, there is a
										buzzer which gives 3 different toine sounds depending on the button that was pressed. On the Receiver device, there is an 
										acknowledgement button which is pressed by the Receiver to acknowledge ...

									<h3>FIT IoT Lab and Riot OS</h3>
									<p>
										FIT-IoT LAB testbed is an open testbed of over 2,700 low power wireless nodes and over 117 mobile
										robots which are available for experimenting with large scale wireless IoT technologies. For the lab project, a sensor node at Saclay FIT-IoT Lab center was used.
										The data from the sensor node were sent to The Things Network with the Payload formatter set to Cayenne LP so that the data
										can be visualized on Cayenne dashboard. Cayenne is a third party integration webhook that enables
										visualization of data that were received on The Things Network.

							<h2>Embedded Software Projects (FPGA, VHDL, HIGH LEVEL SYNTHESIS, VIVADO)</h2>
							<p>Giving intelligence to machine can be super fascinating especially with the current buzz of Artificial. Embedded software design helps push the limits of hardware such as in hardware acceleration design projects. Its application cuts across all sectors-health, agriculture, education,etc. 		</p>

									<p>Hardware Accelerator helps overcome the challenges of hardware for ceertain applications. In the case of a Convolution Neural Network, one of the challenges is that GPUs are power hungry. For this project, a hardware accelerator was design with focus on low power consumption</p>

									<p> Using the IP core made by Vivado might not be suitable for one's application, as such one could want to design custom made IP core or for other instance, one might have some high level code that could be interested in converting into hardware, well High Level Synthesis makes this possible. For this project, I explored HLS with a Fast Fourier Transformation IP </p>

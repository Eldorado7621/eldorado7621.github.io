									</a>
									<p>a CNN model was built to predict if potato is diseased by analysing the picture of the leaf. The uploaded leaf is classified as one of the following "Early Blight", "Late Blight", "Healthy". The end point also gives the confidence level for each prediction.

										The model was deployed to Google Cloud Platform and can be tested with postman by using this endpoint- <a href="https://us-central1-potato-prediction.cloudfunctions.net/predict" target="_blank">here<a>

									<h3>LoRaWAN and The Things Network</h3>
									<p>IoT devices often require interconnections in a network such as Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN). One
way of creating such connection is by using LoraWAN - LoraWAN is a low power wide area networking
protocol. Acceeration, relative humidity and temperature measurements taken by a PySense device were collected, processed and transmitted using LoRa to The
Things Network(TTN). The LoPy board is connected to a LoRaWAN gaateway.  Integration to some third party system for data visualization and possible analysis. In this case, Cayenne (myDevices) was used</p>
attempted.
									
									<h5>HARDWARE: PySense, Lopy4,</h5>
									<h5>SOFTWARE AND PROTOCOL: Python, LoRa</h5>

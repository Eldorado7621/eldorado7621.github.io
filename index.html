									</a>
									<p>BFS is an algorithm for looking for nodes in a tree data structure that satisfy a specified property. Before moving on to
										the nodes at the next depth level, it begins at the root of the tree and investigates every node there.

									</a>
									<p>The Rapid expanding Random Tree is a path planning algorithm that uses random smaples from the search space too construct a tree.
										The root of the tree is the starting point. Each node has only one parent. 
										In this project, the RRT algorithm was implemented in MATLAB with GUI for visualization of the tree growth	</p>

									</a>
									<p>a CNN model was built to predict if potato is diseased by analysing the picture of the leaf. The uploaded leaf is classified as one of the following "Early Blight", "Late Blight", "Healthy". The end point also gives the confidence level for each prediction.

										The model was deployed to Google Cloud Platform and can be tested with postman by using this endpoint- <a href="https://us-central1-potato-prediction.cloudfunctions.net/predict" target="_blank">here<a>

									<h3>LoRaWAN and The Things Network</h3>
									<p>IoT devices often require interconnections in a network such as Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN). One
										way of creating such connection is by using LoraWAN - LoraWAN is a low power wide area networking
										protocol. Acceeration, relative humidity and temperature measurements taken by a PySense device were collected, processed and transmitted using LoRa to The
										Things Network(TTN). The LoPy board is connected to a LoRaWAN gaateway.  Integration to some third party
										system for data visualization and possible analysis. In this case, Cayenne (myDevices) was used</p>

									<h3>The Remote Butler</h3>
									<p>
										The remote Butler device is an IoT device that enables wireless communication between the sender (presumed to be the house owner) 
										and a Receiver (presumed to be the Butler). The Sender device contains 3 buttons which signifies 3 different commands.
										On the Receiver device, there are 3 LEDs each corresponding to the 3 different Sender buttons commands. Also, there is a
										buzzer which gives 3 different toine sounds depending on the button that was pressed. On the Receiver device, there is an 
										acknowledgement button which is pressed by the Receiver to acknowledge ...

									<p>
										FIT-IoT LAB testbed is an open testbed of over 2,700 low power wireless nodes and over 117 mobile
										robots which are available for experimenting with large scale wireless IoT technologies. For the lab project, a sensor node at Saclay FIT-IoT Lab center was used.
										The data from the sensor node were sent to The Things Network with the Payload formatter set to Cayenne LP so that the data
										can be visualized on Cayenne dashboard. Cayenne is a third party integration webhook that enables
										visualization of data that were received on The Things Network.
